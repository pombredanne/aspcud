.TH aspcud 1 "May 01, 2022"  "Version 1.9.6" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
aspcud \- solve dependencies between packages

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aspcud
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIINPUT-FILE\fR] [\fIOUTPUT-FILE\fR] [\fICRITERION\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aspcud
solves package installation/removal/upgrade problems expressed in the CUDF format.
It is intended to be called by package installers, but may also be used independently.

If the tool is not able to find a solution, then it writes "FAIL" to the output file.

.SH ARGUMENTS

The following command-line arguments are accepted:
.TP
.I INPUT-FILE
is the pathname of the file containing the problem specification in CUDF format
(both the universe and the request).
If absent, the specification is read from stdin.
.TP
.I OUTPUT-FILE
is the pathname of the file into which the solution will be written in CUDF output format.
If the file does not exist it will be created,
if it does already exist it will be overwritten without warning.
If absent, output is written to stdout.
.TP
.I CRITERION
selects the optimization criterion. To get a list of supported criteria, see
the \fB\-c\fR option of \&\fIcudf2lp\fR\|(1). If absent, the paranoid criterion
is used. Note that the criterion can be passed via option \fB\-\-criterion\fR
as well.
